This project involves recognizing Arabic handwritten characters using a labeled dataset of grayscale images stored in CSV format. The dataset contains 32Ã—32 pixel images of characters, flattened into vectors.

We performed data exploration, normalization, and visualization, then trained and evaluated models using:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Two Neural Network architectures with k-fold cross-validation

The best-performing model was saved and later reloaded to make predictions on new data.
